# The Fruitcase

Welcome to the **Fruitcase**, a home for some of science bloggery. Like the contents of a [teosinte fruitcase](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiMn5jE3fHNAhUJ8WMKHWKpDPQQjRwIBw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fteosinte.wisc.edu%2Fquestions.html&psig=AFQjCNGES6lTYkZAYDCeuY8TsDSSR37WDQ&ust=1468543635349247), the contents may be aborted attempts that lead to nothing much. My hope is, however, that like some fruitcases, there may be a kernel of good stuff in there somewhere.
