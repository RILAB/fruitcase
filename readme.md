# The Fruitcase

Welcome to the **Fruitcase**, a home for some of science bloggery. Like the contents of a [teosinte fruitcase](https://github.com/RILAB/fruitcase/blob/master/figures/Z_diplo_ear_w.jpg), the contents may be aborted attempts that lead to nothing much. My hope is, however, that like some fruitcases, there may be a kernel of good stuff in there somewhere.
